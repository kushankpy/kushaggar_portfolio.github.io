I’m naturally curious, love learning fast, and enjoy environments that feel a little uncomfortable, chaotic, and challenging because that’s usually where the interesting stuff happens.",

The O-ring compression was held between 20–25% by carefully sizing the groove depth relative to the O-ring cross-section diameter. Below 20% compression the contact force is insufficient to block water ingress, and above 30% the rubber permanently deforms and loses its sealing ability over time. Getting this range right required tolerance stack-up analysis across all mating dimensions to ensure every manufactured unit, not just the ideal design, stayed within the functional window.",
